# 🤖 Twitter Bot: Hashtag Hunter

Welcome to **Hashtag Hunter**, a powerful and flexible Twitter bot built with Python and [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/). This bot can automatically interact with tweets and users based on specific **#hashtags**, making it a perfect assistant for social engagement, campaigns, or research projects.

Your Twitter bot is capable of performing multiple automated actions:

- 🔁 **Retweet** tweets containing specific `#hashtags`
- ❤️ **Like/Favorite** tweets with targeted `#hashtags`
- ➕ **Follow** users who tweet using certain `#hashtags`
- 💬 **DM users** automatically *(with granted permissions)*

All of these actions are configurable and can be combined as needed.
